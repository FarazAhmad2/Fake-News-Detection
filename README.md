# Fake-News-Detection
This NLP project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. We used Logistic Regression and RandomForest Classifier for modelling. Used different evaluation metrics such as accuracy score, confusion matrix, classification report and ROC-AUC curve to evaluate the model.
